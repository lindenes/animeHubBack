# animeHubBack

Sorry I didn't add readmy right away.

This is the back of the AnimeHub website. It's made for a thesis for a university. This was my first time doing this project and I want to get other people's opinions and advice. 

Available registration, registration, add a post with information about anime, edit post, delete post, as well as the administrator and moderator functionality.

I used doobie , cats effect, http4s, scala version 3.3.0, and not much jdbc at all.
